			<hr>
			<p>
			The word "matter" refers to everything in the universe that has mass and takes up space. All matter is made up of atoms of elements.
			<br>
			Sometimes, atoms bond together closely, while at other times they are scattered widely.
			<br>
			States of matter are generally described on the basis of qualities that can be seen or felt. Matter that feels hard and maintains a fixed shape is called a solid; matter that feels wet and maintains its volume but not its shape is called a liquid. Matter that can change both shape and volume is called a gas.
			<br>
			Some introductory chemistry texts name solids, liquids, and gasses as the three states of matter, but higher level texts recognize plasma as the fourth state of matter. Like a gas, plasma can change its volume and shape, but unlike a gas, it can also change its electrical charge.
