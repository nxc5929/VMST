			<p>
			All matter consists of particles called atoms. Atoms bond to each other to form elements, which contain only one kind of atom. Atoms of different elements form compounds, molecules, and objects.
			<br>
			<br>
			Parts of an Atom<br>
			Atoms consist of three parts:<br>
			Protons: Protons are the basis of atoms. While an atom can gain or lose neutrons and electrons, its identity is tied to the number of protons. The symbol for proton number is the capital letter Z.<br>
			Neutrons: The number of neutrons in an atom is indicated by the letter N. The atomic mass of an atom is the sum of its protons and neutrons or Z + N. The strong nuclear force binds protons and neutrons together to form the nucleus of an atom.<br>
			Electrons: Electrons are much smaller than protons or neutrons and orbit around them.<br>
